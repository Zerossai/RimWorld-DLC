Unzip along the path:

How do I get free DLC:

1. Find the DLC files (on any torrent, for example, or ask a friend for them).
2. In each DLC folder go to the path RimWorld\Data\DLCname\About.
3. Open the About.xml file
4. In the <steamAppId>123</steamAppId>(EXAMPLE) line, delete the numbers: <steamAppId></steamAppId>.

5. Do this in each dlc folder
