How do I get free DLC:

1. _Find the DLC files (on any torrent, for example, or ask a friend for them)._
2. _In each DLC folder go to the path RimWorld\Data\DLCname\About._
3. _Open the About.xml file_
4. _In the <steamAppId>123</steamAppId>(EXAMPLE) line, delete the numbers: <steamAppId></steamAppId>._

5. _Do this in each dlc folder_
